# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 
The project is to build data visualization with interactive features on earthquakes around the world. The geoJSON data available on US government website is plotted on Mapbox maps though API requests and utilizing JavaScript, D3 & Leaflet libraries. Objective of the project is to prepare easy to use and interactive earthquake maps to create positive buzz about disaster reporting network. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make an interactive visualization of earthquake data using Javascript, D3 and leaflet libraries on Mapbox maps

## Results

To provide a better user experience and interactive visualization there are multiple layers added to visualize earthquake data. The map can be viewed in street mode, satellite mode and dark mode.

Fig # 13.1 All different map mode (Layers)

Earthquake reported in last 7 days are shown in circle represented on the map. The diameter and color of circles helps to visualize the magnitude of the earthquake.

Fig # 13.2 Earthquake information with tactonic contours (Overlay)

To visualize the earthquake in realtion to the tactonic plates, tactonic plates contours are added to the map to analyze the data better.

Fig # 13.3 Major Earthquakes (Overlay)
To visualize only major earthquakes from past 7 days, another option (Overlay) is added to the map to toggle between all earthquakes and major earthquakes happened in past 7 days.
