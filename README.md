# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 
The project is to build data visualization with interactive features on earthquakes around the world. The geoJSON data available on US government website is plotted on Mapbox maps though API requests and utilizing JavaScript, D3 & Leaflet libraries. The purpose of the project is to provide earthquake maps easy to use and interactive to create positive buzz about disaster reporting network. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make an interactive visualization of earthquake data Javascript, D3 adn leaflet libraries on Mapbox maps

## Results

To provide a better user experience and interactive visualization there are multiple layers added to viualize earthquake data. The map can be viewed in street mode, satellite mode and dark mode.

Fig # 13.1 All different map mode (Layers)

Earthquake reported in last 7 days are shown in circle represented on the map. The diameter and color of circles helps to visualize the magnitude of the circle.

Fig # 13.2 Earthquake information with tactonic contours (Overlay)

To visualize the earthquake in realtion to the tactonic plates, tactonic plates contours are added to the map soas toanalyze the data better.

Fig # 13.3 Major Earthquakes (Overlay)
To visualize only major earthquakes from past 7 days, another option is added to the map to just toggle between all earthquakes and major earthquakes as an overlay option to the user
